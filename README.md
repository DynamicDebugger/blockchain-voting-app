# Blockchain Voting System

## Overview

The Blockchain Voting System is a decentralized application that allows users to vote for their favorite candidates securely and transparently using blockchain technology. This application ensures that each user can vote only once, preventing any potential fraud or manipulation in the voting process.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting**: Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure transparency and integrity in the voting process.
- **Single Vote Per User**: Each user can only cast one vote, ensuring fair participation.
- **Dynamic Candidate Display**: Candidates and their vote counts are fetched and displayed dynamically.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Vote counts are updated in real-time to reflect the latest voting results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Web3.js**: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain
- **MetaMask**: For managing Ethereum accounts and transactions

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-voting-system.git
   cd blockchain-voting-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure to have Node.js installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your Ethereum environment**:
   - Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and create an account.
   - Connect your MetaMask wallet to a test network (e.g., Rinkeby or Ropsten).

4. **Deploy the smart contract**:
   - Compile and deploy your smart contract using Remix or Truffle.
   - Update the contract address in the JavaScript code where the contract is initialized.

5. **Run the application**:
   Open `index.html` in your web browser or use a local server (e.g., Live Server extension in VSCode).

## Usage

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet.
2. Select a candidate from the list.
3. Submit your vote. You can only vote once, and if you attempt to vote again, an error message will be displayed.
4. View the updated vote counts in real-time.
